ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Brandon!

I'm a Full Stack Developer that specializes in web based technologies, but have also branched out and worked in a diverse set of other areas. 
Most of my professional experience comes from working with Content Management Systems (CMS) particularly Drupal and WordPress while also having
focused on custom development for CRMs like Salesforce.
